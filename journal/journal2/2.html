                        Heterotrophs demand oxygen while supplying carbon dioxide to the environment. 
                        They have different supply and demand in their interactions with nature. 
                        Autotrophs inversely require carbon dioxide and provide oxygen.  
                        Through photosynthesis, plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. 
                        Therefore, it is beneficial for humans to surround themselves with plants, but plants and trees are decreasing in their numbers as they are being utilized on different occasions as natural resources. 
                        Then, is there any way for technology to reduce carbon dioxide while preventing nature from deteriorating? 
                        That’s what the Direct Air Capture Technology (DAC) is all about. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        DAC is a technology that directly captures air, and it only pulls out carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through chemical functions. 
                        Using solid adsorbent filters that combine with CO2, the filter gets heated and stores the concentrated CO2. 
                        Concentrated CO2 can be either used in fields or stored. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The process of DAC is similar to the process of photosynthesis. 
                        Direct Air Capture Technology is a substitute for photosynthesis that can offer solutions for all environmental issues. 
                        Every country has varying amounts of resources, and each country has different resources that they value. 
                        This technology solves the shortage of natural resources and even functions as plants by doing artificial photosynthesis. 
                        And the technology could further use it in innovative ways, such as filtering or extracting other chemicals from the air.
