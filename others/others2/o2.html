                        Q. What do you want to achieve through the summer camp?
                    </p>

                        If someone asks what you are passionate about, I would answer writing journals is what I am interested in without any debut. 
                        Since I was in middle school, it was my weekly cycle to read articles in the new york times. 
                        Week by week, I each chose something I was into and analyzed it. 
                        It was an excellent opportunity to experience other’s writing styles and how they view the world. 
                        Influenced by magnificent writers, I followed the path to become a journalist. 
                        I participated in the school newspaper club and city-wide news club as a student reporter. 
                        Experiencing a journalist’s life in advance was so awesome and even encouraged my dream path. 
                        Though I was a student journalist who explored the world and shared information, there was something limited on me, that I was an isolated writer. 
                        Publishing articles via school and websites didn’t allow me to have a whole experience exploring the world and getting feedback. 
                        The readers were still selected(usually my classmates and neighbors in our city), and feedback was also the same all the time.  
                        It was hard for me to be disinterested and improve to be a better journalist. 
                        So through this summer camp, I hope to earn a more comprehensive view of the world, meeting other young passionate journalists, and cooperate altogether. 
                        I am also excited to achieve valuable feedback and more readers for my writings.

                        Q. What's your diversity?

                    </p>

                        I believe my academic experience differs from others. 
                        I worked hard to connect the relationship between journalism and other academic fields. 
                        All the world connects. 
                        Well-developed technology such as direct air capture improves the environment, and newspapers and journals explaining new technology develop the world economy and welfare altogether. 
                        For my project, I applied journalism with computer science. 
                        Creating a website based on programs - HTML and CSS - I constructed my newspaper website for the public. 
                        I wrote down my articles and shared them with my community members, forming new worldwide subscribers. 
                        Regardless of the topics, I created articles about history, science, technology, and more. 
                        The purpose of my project was to associate two fields together and help people find out the interconnection of the world. 
                        My task was overall successful, and currently, it is still going on for two years. 
                        I think appealing journals are essential; however, sharing with society is necessary, too.
